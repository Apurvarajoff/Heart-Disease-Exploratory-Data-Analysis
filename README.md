# Heart-Disease-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

# Prerequisites for this project: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.


Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating insights from a dataset. It can help you to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in your data, and can be a useful way to communicate your findings to others.

There are many different types of visualizations that you can use, and the best choice for a particular dataset will depend on the nature of the data and the insights you are trying to convey. Some common types of visualizations for exploring a heart disease dataset include scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms.

Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables. For example, you could use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between age and cholesterol levels in a heart disease dataset.

Line plots are similar to scatter plots, but they show the trends in the data over time. For example, you could use a line plot to visualize changes in blood pressure over time.

Bar plots are useful for comparing the values of a categorical variable between different groups. For example, you could use a bar plot to compare the prevalence of heart disease among different age groups.

Histograms are useful for visualizing the distribution of a numerical variable. For example, you could use a histogram to visualize the distribution of cholesterol levels in a heart disease dataset.

Overall, the key to effective data visualization is to choose the right type of plot for the data you are working with, and to use clear and informative labels and titles to help communicate your insights to others.



# We are going to divide the project into 6 parts:

  1) Heart Disease EDA - Age (DistPlot)
  
  2) Heart Disease EDA - Categorical Columns (Pie Charts)
  
  3) Heart Disease EDA - ViolinPlot
  
  4) Heart Disease EDA - Correlation (HeatMap)
  
  5) Heart Disease EDA - Corrlation (PairPlot)
  
  6) Heart Disease EDA - Correlation - (JointPlot)
